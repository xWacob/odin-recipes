    <h3>Description </h3>
    <p>This shouldn't take you any time at all. This is one of the most simple recipes you could ever follow, but if you are looking for a quick and yummy snack, this is the go to for me. It combines two of my favorite things, cheese and chips. Specifically, tortilla chips and shredded cheese are used. It is just something that you can throw together for a nice late night snack or whenever you feel like it!!
