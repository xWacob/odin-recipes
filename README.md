The project is to create a website that holds various recipes. I believe I will be using the techniques I learned throughout the past 5 or so lessons to complete this. I want to be able to do this without looking up the solution so here it goes...

At the end of the project, I learned how simple it is to create a small website. I was so intimidated by making a website before but now I see how easy it can be (even though I'm sure it gets much harder).
